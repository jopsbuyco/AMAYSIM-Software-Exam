# AMAYSIM-Software-Exam
Technical Exam for Software in AMAYSIM

Hi
The Cart program is the actual code for handling the software exam requirements.
The Sheet1 program is the coding for the interfacing with the Windows Excel sheet.

As this was programmed using VBA in Excel, this means this was done using Excel workbooks as an interface.
Any 2010 or later Windows Excel should be able to run this.
I have included the actual working workbook in the file i gave to Jhayme from HR.

If you guys are interested, i can forward you the actual working workbook also. 
I used excel VBA since this is the programming language i know best other than SAP ABAP, and since it shares a lot of similarities with VB.

You can reach me at jopsbuyco@gmail.com if you are still interested.
